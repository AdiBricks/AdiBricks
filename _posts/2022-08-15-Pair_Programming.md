title: Pair Programming
description: Don't do it alone.  Pair Programming allows you to have secondary thinking as you work, not just a reflection after you are done, but real time support.

# "Real World" Projects
You, your pair, and your Scrum Team will collaboratively Build, deploy and host Web Site.  This Web project contains Technicals learned throughout the Trimester.  This will be done in increments.  Each Monday an assignment will be given and the next week it will be under Live Review.

- Feature Considerations for Project
    - Final Project and Blog Requirements
        - A fun zone, also a unique idea(s)
        - Educational zones that capture every key learning objective
        - A location that highlights individuals, jobs, and technical capabilities (About Us)
    - Project Technicals
        - Managing PBL Requirement for Project (Issues, Scrum Board)
        - Use of "Python Functions and Classes" in backend.
        - Use of "JavaScript, HTML, CSS" in frontend
        - Data Structure exchange between frontend and backend: Data Frames from Pandas, "SQL" or "MongoDB" databases, etc.

- Individual GitHub Pages considerations for Big Ideas 1 - 5
    - Each week we will be studying Big Ideas in Collage Board Test Prep and PBL Tech Talks
    - GH Pages should be used like notes to capture PBL, Python, JavaScript key learnings each week!  
    - BTW, using GH Pages will make you Code and Blog at the same time.  Jupyter Notebooks using Python and Markdown will enable running code in notes. The Teachers like running code!  Jupyter Notebooks can also do JavaScript, Bash and other languages.


### Hacks
> Establish PBL and Comp Sci attitude; often called an Agile Mindset.
- Watch a video [How I Would Learn To Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9WqpQp8VSU)
- Attitude.  An Agile mindset is not knowing the answer, making lots of mistakes and performing iteration.  A successful grade is dependent on making mistakes, research, asking questions, and iteration.
- Suggestion. Please bring a personal laptop to class daily.  The Internet, ChatGPT, and AP Classroom web site will be considered a text book.  
- Requirements. Everything will be distributed electronically.  All code you develop will be delivered to the Cloud. No paper!
- Grading guidelines. There will be key technical objectives which will require producing tangibles. Essentially, it is impossible to be late with work if you work consistently attend class, work in class and turn in progressive tangibles each week.  Thus, failure to have work will result in seed point deduction.  Additionally, late work must be defended in office hours and will receive 10% deduction.  
    - High "A" is very tough to achieve, something beyond the given tangible requirements.  Something that exhibits an unforced desire to learn and Code/Code/Code.
    - Low "A" is consistency in producing tangibles toward Team Project and Individual GH Page according to Issues and Scrum Board plans.   Plans must be consistent with key objectives and technicals.
    - "B" is having flaws in consistency or tangible shortcomings, but mostly on track.  A flaw would be mostly working code, attempts, but incomplete.
    - "C" is a lack consistent effort, lacking tangibles. Lack of producing working Code.
    - Below "C" is composed of Slash/Slash/Slash offenses. Lack of attendance, disruptive behaviors, doing work from other classes during CompSci class time, paper visible in class, and turning in tangibles that you can't represent in live review.
    - Zero is a result of plagiarism.  The Teachers will likely miss first offense of plagiarism, thus any offense will result in an inquiry on previous work. Remember this is an effort based class.
