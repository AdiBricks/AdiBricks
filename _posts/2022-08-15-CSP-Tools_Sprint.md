### PBL Sprint 0 / Week 0
Learning outcome.  Getting adapted to the Agile mindset used in Computer Science.  Additionally, getting introduced to GitHub and showing usage of VSCode.   Building a personal and running GitHub Pages.
- Wednesday - "Introduction Sprint".  Pick pair share partner, Pick crossover pair, Establish team of four.  Based off of modulo mathematics (remainder) there can only be 3 teams of 5, depending on remainder divisible by 4.   Spend some time talking and getting to know each other.  Consider key roles in Project Teams as Scrum Master (Issues, Scrum Board), DevOps (GitHub, Deploy, .gitignore, requirements.txt), Frontend Developer (HTML, CSS, Javascript), Backend Developer (Flask, Python)
- Thursday - Review "Tools and Equipment".  Bringing your laptop.  Setup GitHub Pages and Tools and push code to your Repo and track updates of Fastpages to deployment.
- Friday - Start with Pair Share coding. Spend 25 minutes at keyboard finishing installation and performing GitHub pages coding, while Pair Share observes and consults.  Next 25 minutes Pairs reverse roles.


### Hack Prepartation
> Look for 'hacks' to know what to do.  Try to be done with these things and get things working on your machine before Monday.
- A laptop, that you bring to class every day with the Development Tools installed on it.
- GitHub Account, VSCode will be used to push/pull changes. GitHub is where we store and share code in the cloud, think of Google Docs but for Code.
- GitHub Pages will be used to host your personal web site, notes, and experiences.  Building pages will teach Markdown, HTML Fragments, and JavaScript.
- Jupyter Notebooks will be used in conjunction with GitHub Pages to build running Python Code in your Technical Notes.
- Slack Account, install App on Laptop, get used to reading announcements. Slack is the tool will use for messaging, we have been averaging 50K messages per year.
- Python is the key language you will be using in this class.  Flask, Jinja2, HTML, CSS, JavaScript are the key supporting technicals you will be using to enhance your learning.
- VSCode is the code editor we will be using in this class.  VSCode is more than and editor, this type of tool is often called an Interactive Development Environment (IDE). 

## Hacks
Students need to demonstrate all these tools running to Scrum Team and then the Teacher.  Problems need to be worked out quickly.  Before asking Teacher ask 3 other students.  <mark>Do not delay in Tool Setup task, there will be no late makeup for points!!!</mark>  Tool and Equipment setup is like attendance, without Tools and Equipment you are effectually absent.
- Share link to personal GitHub pages running on github.io.  My suggestion is to change index.html to show it is really yours.
- Share link to a new page (_posts) in your Fastpages project show use of  Markdown and/or HTML fragments.  You will need to learn special date requirements of a file as well as a little Markdown or HTML.
- Capture image/screen capture of GitHub Pages project showing use of an Integrated Development Environment (VS Studio)
- Share link showing your GitHub insights.  This is your personal activity of commit history.
